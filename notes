Smarter AI behaviour:
Preflop: Raise if pair, if both cards>=10. Raise 3 big blinds. Check/fold if both cards <7. Call if a card 7<=card<10

Flop: If fullhouse or greater, go all in. (later)Check if straight draw, Raise/bet if flush, straight, three of a kind. Raise/bet lower for 2 pair, pair. Check/fold if high card.
Fold if bet is higher than the raise/check threshold

Turn: If fullhouse or greater, go all in. (later)Check if straight draw, Raise/bet if flush, straight, three of a kind. Raise/bet lower for 2 pair, pair. Check/fold if high card.
Fold if bet is higher than the raise/check threshold

River: If fullhouse or greater, go all in. (later)Check if straight draw, Raise/bet if flush, straight, three of a kind. Raise/bet lower for 2 pair, pair. Check/fold if high card.
Fold if bet is higher than the raise/check threshold


Perfect AI behaviour:
?







AI ideas:
Fish AI: Ai that calls everything
Bot AI: Ai that folds everything
Crazy AI: Ai that plays randomly




Potential ideas:
Reinforcement learning + game theory?
Can start off with an the Crazy AI and have it learn from the perfect AI player? Or genetic algorithm, have a lot of Crazy AI's play, learn what works and kill off the ones
with suboptimal behaviour.




Existing poker AI: can have dumb AI's as well
Compare AI's, GANS networks idea?
